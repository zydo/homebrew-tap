# Homebrew formula for the headless `alle` channel (macOS + Linux).
#
# This is the canonical source of the formula. The `homebrew-alle` tap ships a
# copy of it; the release workflow updates the tap's copy only after the
# matching `alle-proxy` release exists on PyPI, using
# `scripts/update-homebrew-formula.py` to fill the `url`/`sha256` below with the
# digest PyPI recorded for the published sdist. The resource pins are taken from
# uv.lock (tests/test_homebrew_formula.py keeps them from drifting).
#
# Product boundary: this channel is deliberately headless. It installs the CLI,
# background daemon, loopback control API, and the version-locked bundled Web UI
# — never the `[tray]` extra, `rumps`, the `alle-tray` launcher, `alle.tray`, or
# `alle.companion`. The base wheel still ships the companion thin client (the
# pip/uv channel uses it, and it is unit-tested there); `install` strips that
# GUI surface from this keg so the product boundary holds regardless.

    <<~EOS
      This is the headless alle channel: CLI, background daemon, loopback
      control API, and the bundled Web UI — no menu-bar app or tray.

      Manage the background daemon with brew services rather than
      `alle daemon install` (which would register a competing launchd/systemd
      unit for the same user):

        brew services start alle      # start now and at login
        brew services stop alle

      State lives in ~/.alle. Open the Web UI with `alle ui`.
